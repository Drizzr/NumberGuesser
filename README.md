# Ai

This project was heavily inspired by the following book:
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

It implements the stochastic gradient descent using a full matrix-based approach (as suggested in the book)
which dramaticly speeds up the entire process!

For Example:
My Programm needs only 96.9 seconds for training the model for 30 epochs where as the example from the book needs
322.9 seconds (measured on an Macbook Air M1).
